# About Project

A browser-based password manager that generates unique, strong passwords.

# The App

The goal of our app is to be able to securely store and categorize login credentials, payment information, passports, wireless routers and more. The user can create vaults to separate personal information from work. Use autofill on websites so you never have to remember another password again.

# Languages

The languages we plan on using to develop this app is JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.
